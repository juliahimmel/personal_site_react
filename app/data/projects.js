But, without further guidance, developers and designers who worked on features for CareerFoundry would make font and color decisions on the fly, leading to a lack of consistency across the application and brand. I created a small, clear style guide when I started at the company, and it\'s still in heavy use today.",

Then, I worked with another developer to build the dashboard.',

            longDescription: 'CareerFoundry sells mentored, online courses. When students would sign up for a course, it would take some time to match them with an appropriate mentor in their time zone, so the course would not begin immediately. In the interim, students had little information about the status of their course after they paid, and they would send the support staff panicked emails. In the course of doing UX research for the dashboard redesign project, I realized that some form of onboarding was needed. With guidance from a senior UX designer, I took an onboarding site from wireframes through prototyping and user testing, then built it with one other developer.',
